# phpEmail

The Email script build in php to engage it with your html code.

You also need to download the PHPMailer from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer and adjust the path of PHPMailerAutoload.php file as per your placement in the directory in the email.php file.

Where to update the path in email.php:- require 'mailer/PHPMailerAutoload.php';

Thank You
